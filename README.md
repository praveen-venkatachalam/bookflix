# Bookflix
The purpose of this project is to develop a course book recommendation system using machine learning algorithms that can suggest course books based on userâ€™s interests, past read books, and recommend books read/liked by similar users. 

The system will analyze user patterns, preferences, interests, and requirements to generate a list of relevant course books. This system aims to provide a personalized and efficient solution to the common problem of finding the right course books.
 
The AI recommendation system for course books will offer a more individualized approach to book selection, empowering students and boosting their involvement with the course materials. Students will be more likely to achieve academically and fully benefit from their course if they have the right books in their hands.
